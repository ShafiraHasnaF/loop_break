a little story behind this loop_break, i often get hyperfocused while coding and forget to take breaks. so yeah i built this.

this is my first project using TailwindCSS. honestly, the class names felt overwhelming at first (coming from Bootstrap), but i grew to love how much control it gives me over the design!
